# Adding/editing data 
## Error codes 
Navigate to error-codes/src/main/resources/data 
- Within here, there is a CSV per machine 

## Machines 
- This is stored within the code. If you wish to add a new machine, navigate to src/main/java/com/wes/error_codes/model/Machine.java and add a new one 
- You must add the path to the corresponding CSV here too 
- Addi can assist with this 

// Todo do it per machine... 
// will need something in the pipeline to ensure that number of machines = number of csvs
